# SFML-Tetris
**My study project-1**

This is a simple implementation of the Tetris game written in C++. Developed using SFML library, it offers a classic Tetris experience with simple mechanics and addictive gameplay.
The game features music, score tracking, and the core Tetris gameplay mechanics, providing players with an engaging and a bit nostalgic experience.

I should also say, referring to the Bio part of my profile, this is all part of my little experiment. I would love to learn more about game development, maybe even to become a part of this world.
I'm starting with the basics, keeping in mind some memories of C++ from my university days and trying to bring something new from my SAP experience.

So this is my first step :)

## Features
 - Classic Tetris gameplay
 - Customizable controls
 - Score tracking
 - Level progression

## How to Play
### **Controls:**
Use the arrow keys to move the falling tetromino left, right, or down.
Press the 'Up' arrow key to rotate the tetromino clockwise.
Press the 'Space' key to drop the tetromino instantly to the bottom.

### Objective:
Fill complete horizontal lines with blocks to clear them.
Keep playing as long as possible without reaching the top of the screen.

### Scoring:
Score points for each line cleared.
Earn more points for clearing multiple lines simultaneously:
 - 1 line cleared = +100 points
 - 2 lines cleared = +300 points
 - 3 lines cleared = +700 points
 - 4 lines cleared = +1500 points

### Leveling Up:
As you clear more lines, the game will speed up, increasing the difficulty. Every 1500 points, the delay of the tetrominos on each line will decrease by 0.05 seconds.
